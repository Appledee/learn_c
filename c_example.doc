Example 1
/* An example to branch into functions by checking if the iteration number is even or odd*/
#include <stido.h>
int main()
{
  int counter = 0;
  while(counter < 100)
    {
      ++counter;
      if(counter & 1 != 0)
        {
          /* do something if the iteration number is odd */
        }
      else
        {
          /* do something if the iteration number is even*/
        }
    }
  return 0;
}


Example 2
/* Change the iteration number to a pointer to int type*/
/* Try hardcode a memory addres to the pointer. Even if the address are conflicted, the designated value can still be written into, 
/* half into the counter addres, half into the hardcoded memory address which found to be quite interesting*/

#include <stido.h>

int ocunter = 0 /global variable
int main()
{
  int *int_p;
  int_p = &counter; /e.g., int_p is assigned to 0x20000000
  while(*int_p < 10)
    {
      ++(*int_p);
    }
   int_p = (int *) 0x20000002U;  /type casting is needed in order to be compiled correctly
   //int_p = (int *) 0x20000004U;
   *int_p = 0xDEADBEEF;
   return 0;
}
